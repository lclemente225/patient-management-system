# Patient Management System
I am creating a patient management system for a dental practice.

## Purpose and Functions
It will be used to show the schedule of the patients throughout the year. You'll be able to text message them, send emails, receive notifications if they have confirmed their appointment and send them forms to fill out before arriving for their appointment. An additional function that will be worked on after the base product is finished will be the ability to integrate an api into a website for booking.
